# 3D-Scanning-Motion-Capture

## Exercise 01 - Back-Projection
In this exercise we generate 3D meshes from depth and color maps which can be captured by camera
like a Microsoft Kinect. We provide a basic virtual sensor class that reads the camera data from image files
(see VirtualSensor.h). Our task was to project the depth from a single frame to 3D world space and to save it
as a 3D mesh with the corresponding colors of the color map. Follow the comments in this source file.

## Exercise 02 - Implicit Surfaces - Marching Cubes
In this exercise we generate 3D meshes from implicit surfaces.

## Exercise 03 - Gaussion - Surface - Registration
In this exercise, we explore different optimization problems, that can be solved with a (non-)linear solver,
Ceres (http://ceres-solver.org/) in our case.
